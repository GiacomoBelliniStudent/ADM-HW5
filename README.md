### Dataset Description:

In this work, we have used the [Marvel Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network?select=hero-network.csv) available on the Kaggle. This contains two types of data, one in which we can see two-heroes who have collaborated in a same comic together and in the other we the different comics along with all the heroes present. We used these dataset to build two types of networks and performed analysis on five major topic:


1. Extraction network features
2. Find Top superheros based on the centrality measures
3. Shortest path between two super heroes
4. Disconnecting Graphs
5. Extracting Communities


The repository contains:

- A **README**.md file
